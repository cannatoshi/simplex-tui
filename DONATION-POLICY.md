## Why No Monero?

As of July 2024, the **EU Anti-Money Laundering Regulation 2024/1624** imposes strict requirements on privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies.

### Legal Requirements

Article 79 of EU AML Regulation 2024/1624 requires:

> "Obliged entities shall not keep anonymous accounts, anonymous passbooks, anonymous safe-deposit boxes or anonymous crypto-asset accounts."

### Our Position

- Monero's privacy features make compliance impractical
- We cannot verify the source of Monero donations
- Accepting Monero could expose us to legal liability
- This applies to all privacy coins (Zcash shielded, etc.)

### Alternatives

If you prefer privacy:

- **Bitcoin:** Use CoinJoin or mixing services before donating
- **Ethereum:** Donations are pseudonymous
- **Ko-fi:** Guest checkout without account

We respect your privacy while complying with applicable laws.

---

## Anonymous Donations

### Allowed (with limits)

- Donations under **€500** may be anonymous
- Use guest checkout on Ko-fi
- Cryptocurrency without identification

### Limits

- Donations over **€1,000** require identification
- This is required by German anti-money laundering laws
- We may contact you to verify identity

### What We Track

For legal compliance, we record:

- Date and amount
- Payment method
- Transaction ID (if applicable)
- Donor name (if provided)

We do **NOT** share this information except as required by law.

## Refund Policy
